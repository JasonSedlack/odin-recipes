        <ul>
            <li>6 lemons.</li>

        <p><strong>Tools:</strong></p>

        <ul>
            <li>Mixing bowl.</li>
            <li>Cooking pot.</li>
            <li>Mesh strainer.</li>
            <li>Lemon/vegetable peeler.</li>
            <li>Lemon juicer (optional).</li>
            <li>Serving pitcher.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Steps:</strong></p>

        <ol>
            <li>Wash lemons. If they feel waxy, scrub them under hot water.</li>
            <li>Peel the zest from <strong>6 lemons</strong> with a veggie peeler. You want the yellow zest,
             but don't be too worried about getting some of the white. Set the peeled lemons aside.</li>
            <li>Cover the lemon zest with <strong>1 and a quarter cup of sugar</strong> in a mixing bowl and 
             combine by tossing. Cover with some cling wrap and leave for at least 2 hours, but longer is better.
             Leaving them overnight works very nicely.</li>
            <li>Bring <strong>5 cups of water</strong> to the boil, in a pot on high heat. Turn off heat and pour in lemon-sugar mix.</li>
            <li>Bring water to a boil in a pot over high heat; turn off heat and add the lemon-sugar mixture, including the 
                peel. Stir, then leave as the sugars dissolve, which should be about 5 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>Strain the liquid back into the mixing bowl through a mesh strainer to excise the peel.</li>
            <li><strong>Do not add the lemon juice immediately.</strong> Let the liquid sit until room temperature; about half an hour should do.</li>
            <li>Cut the lemons in half and squeeze into the bowl through the mesh strainer. Pour lemonade into a serving pitcher, cover in cling wrap,
                 and refrigerate until nice and chilly.
            </li>
            <li>Pouring the lemonade over ice without chilling it first will melt the ice and water it down, so get it nice and cold.
                 I'd recommend a couple of hours. Then pour over some ice and prepare to get seriously quenched.
